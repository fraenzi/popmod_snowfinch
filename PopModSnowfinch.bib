	abstract = {Mark-recapture estimators assume no loss of marks to provide unbiased estimates of population parameters. We describe a hidden Markov model ({HMM}) framework that integrates a mark loss model with a Cormack–Jolly–Seber model for survival estimation. Mark loss can be estimated with single-marked animals as long as a sub-sample of animals has a permanent mark. Double-marking provides an estimate of mark loss assuming independence but dependence can be modeled with a permanently marked sub-sample. We use a log-linear approach to include covariates for mark loss and dependence which is more flexible than existing published methods for integrated models. The {HMM} approach is demonstrated with a dataset of black bears (Ursus americanus) with two ear tags and a subset of which were permanently marked with tattoos. The data were analyzed with and without the tattoo. Dropping the tattoos resulted in estimates of survival that were reduced by 0.005–0.035 due to tag loss dependence that could not be modeled. We also analyzed the data with and without the tattoo using a single tag. By not using. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear on-line.},

	abstract = {Capture-recapture models were originally developed to account for encounter probabilities that are less than 1 in free-ranging animal populations. Nowadays, these models can deal with the movement of animals between different locations and are also used to study transitions between different states. However, their use to estimate transitions between states does not account for uncertainty in state assignment. I present the extension of multievent models, which does incorporate this uncertainty. Multievent models belong to the family of hidden Markov models. I also show in this article that the memory model, in which the next state or location is influenced by the previous state occupied, can be fully treated within the framework of multievent models.},
